#
# Documentation:
#   The file consists of multiple repeated sections,
#   where every sections defines settings for a virtual machine.
#
#   A section has got the following format:
#     <string:machine-name>:
#       box: <string:image-reference>
#       cpus: <number:cpus-to-allocate>
#       memory: <number:memory-in-megabytes>
#       files:
#       - <string:file-1>
#       - ...
#       - <string:file-N>
#       commands:
#       - <string:command-1>
#       - ...
#       - <string:command-N>
#       forwarded_port:
#         guest: <number:guest-port>
#         host: <number:host-port>
#       synced_folder: <true|false>
#       synced_folder_projects: <true|false>
#
#   'box':
#        Is a reference to vagrant up image.
#        If it is not specified, 'generic/ubuntu1604' is used by default.
#        Search for available images here https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search
#   'cpus':
#        Number of CPUs to allocate for VM.
#        If it is not specified, '1' is used by default.
#   'memory':
#        Amount of memory to allocate for VM in megabytes.
#        If it is not specified, '2048' is used by default.
#   'files':
#        A sequence of files to upload to /tmp directory during VM provisioning.
#        If it is not specified, no files are uploaded.
#        Specified files are provisioned before any provisioning commands are executed.
#   'commands':
#        A sequence of shell commands to execute during VM provisioning.
#        If it is not specified, no custom commands are executed.
#   'forwarded_port':
#        Host to guest port forwarding specification.
#        If it is not specified, port forwarding is not enabled.
#        Note: Hyper-V provider does not support this feature.
#   'synced_folder':
#        Flag to enable two-way synchronization of the current directory on a host with /vagrant directory on a VM.
#        If it is not specified, the current folder is not synchronized.
#        Note: Hyper-V provider uses SMB for synchronization, it may trigger prompt for password for folder sharing.
#   'synced_folder_projects':
#        Flag to enable two-way synchronization of the parent directory on a host with /projects directory on a VM.
#        If it is not specified, the parent folder is not synchronized.
#        Note: Hyper-V provider uses SMB for synchronization, it may trigger prompt for password for folder sharing.
